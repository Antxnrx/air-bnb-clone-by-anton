# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview

This project is a static clone of the Airbnb website, primarily focused on strengthening my foundational skills in HTML and CSS, especially CSS. The idea was to replicate a modern, visually appealing website to deepen my understanding of web design basics.

**Key Points:**
- **Purpose:** This project was created to build a strong foundation in HTML and CSS.
- **Responsiveness:** The website is not responsive and is best viewed on a laptop or desktop screen.
- **Learning Path:** I plan to further develop my skills by making future projects responsive.
- **Non-Commercial:** This project is purely for educational purposes and is not intended for any commercial use.
